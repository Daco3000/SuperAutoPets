TO-DO LIST
----------
sometimes randomise enemy pet attributes, such as health, attack, level and tokens
enemy team order should be more logical, e.g. ants at the front, horses at back etc.

create tier system for pet rarities
    will have to create a new 'pet_tiers' folder to store all the 'tier_x' modules when all pets are implemented
    add all new pets
    add all foods
    add sloth

IMPORTANT BUGS
--------------
if pet at end dies from mosquito attack, and both last fighting pets die in battle, then game does not result in draw

MAYBE IMPLEMENT
---------------
create different versions for different operating systems, so that clear terminal command works on all OSes.
or maybe find out what os the program is running on and use the respective os clear command.
