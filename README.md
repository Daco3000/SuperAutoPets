# Super Auto Pets

A simple Python clone of the game Super Auto Pets.

This was my first ever Python project, so the code is heavily unoptimised and uses only basic coding constructs.

I made this before I knew how to program a GUI, so the program is entriely console based (and not very fun)

This project is not affiliated with Team Wood Games, the creators of the original game.
